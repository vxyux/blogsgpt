## ðŸ¤– About BlogsGPT
BlogsGPT is a blogging website that 'incorperates the power of AI' (not really as no OpenAI API has been used). This project serves more as a practice ground for myself to learn more about Laravel's magic. <br>
The following has been worked on:
-   Laravel Components
-   Factories
-   Seeders
-   Model Relationships
-   Tailwind CSS
